- 👋 Hi, I’m @rayniel95 and my name is Rainyel Ramos. I am a young computer scientist graduate in [Havana University](http://www.uh.cu), [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba). I graduated in November, 2020. Passionate about machine learning, blockchain technology, distributed systems and cryptography, I have read some interesting books: Distributed Systems written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Decentralized Applications written by Siraj Raval, Architecture for Blockchain Applications written by Xiwei Xu and many papers in www.researchgate.net. My interest in distributed systems started when I implemented Chord DHT in a project, I was fascinated with the auto estabilize property of this data structure.
- 👀 I’m interested in distributed systems, machine learning and blockchain technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with blockchain development with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting blockchain (machine learning) projects.
